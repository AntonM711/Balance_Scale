My main language is Java and I used Selenium WebDriver to run my automation test.
I decided not to create additional folders separately for Utilities, Pages, Step Definitions and did not use Cucumber to run this code 
because it is, in this case, time-wasting as it is a 1 time page that will not be used again. In real work I would have implemented Cucumber BDD POM 
to have all reusable elements saved for easy access, as well as configuration.properties file that would have my url and browser I use saved. 
Thank you for giving me this opportunity!
